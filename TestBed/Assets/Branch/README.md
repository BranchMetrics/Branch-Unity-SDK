## FAQ

1. __What if you go down?! Or there is a poor connection?__

At Branch, we live, breath uptime and performance. Just in case, we've got mechanisms internal to the SDK to deal with network issues. We always call the callbacks with the error parameter describing the issue. If the phone is in airplane mode and the connection is not available, the callbacks are called immediately. If there is a server latency, we timeout after 3 seconds and will retry 4 more times with a 3 second pause in between each. These timeouts are adjustable on the singleton instance by calling setNetworkTimeout (s), setRetryCount and setRetryInterval (s).

## Installation

#### Get it on the Unity Store

Install the package from Unity here: [http://u3d.as/eX3](http://u3d.as/eX3)

#### Download the raw files

Download code from here: [S3 Package](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/branchhost/BranchUnityWrapper.unitypackage)

#### Or just clone this project!

After acquiring the `BranchUnityWrapper.unityPackage` through one of these choices, you can import it into your project by clicking `Assets -> Import Package`.

## Move Plugins Folder
Due to Unity requirements, our UnityPackage file must have all of its contents in a single folder. This means that you'll have to manually move the `Plugins` folder out of our `Branch` folder, and into the root of your `Assets` folder. If you have an existing Plugins folder, just merge our contents into it.

![Move Plugins Folder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BranchMetrics/Branch-Unity-SDK/8670cf9347e4d7c9a88e7c9c4263aa2eed3f2a27/Docs/Screenshots/move-to-assets.gif)

### Register you app

You can sign up for your own app id at [https://dashboard.branch.io](https://dashboard.branch.io)

## Configuration (for tracking)

Ideally, you want to use our links any time you have an external link pointing to your app (share, invite, referral, etc) because:

1. Our dashboard can tell you where your installs are coming from
1. Our links are the highest possible converting channel to new downloads and users
1. You can pass that shared data across install to give new users a custom welcome or show them the content they expect to see

Our linking infrastructure will support anything you want to build. If it doesn't, we'll fix it so that it does: just reach out to alex@branch.io with requests.

#### Unity Scene

To allow Branch to configure itself, you must add a BranchPrefab asset to your scene. Simply drag into your scene, and then specify your APP_KEY in the properties.

![Branch Unity Config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BranchMetrics/Branch-Unity-SDK/8670cf9347e4d7c9a88e7c9c4263aa2eed3f2a27/Docs/Screenshots/branch-key.png)

#### iOS Note

If you're creating an iOS app for your Unity project, you must enable Objective C exceptions in the Build Settings in order for Branch to compile.

![iOS Project Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BranchMetrics/Branch-Unity-SDK/8670cf9347e4d7c9a88e7c9c4263aa2eed3f2a27/Docs/Screenshots/enable-exceptions.png)

### Register a URI scheme direct deep linking (optional but recommended)

You can register your app to respond to direct deep links (yourapp:// in a mobile browser) by adding a URI scheme in the YourProject-Info.plist file. Make sure to change **yourapp** to a unique string that represents your app name.

1. In Xcode, click on YourProject-Info.plist on the left.
1. Find URL Types and click the right arrow. (If it doesn't exist, right click anywhere and choose Add Row. Scroll down and choose URL Types)
1. Add "yourapp", where yourapp is a unique string for your app, as an item in URL Schemes as below:

![URL Scheme Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BranchMetrics/Branch-Unity-SDK/8670cf9347e4d7c9a88e7c9c4263aa2eed3f2a27/Docs/Screenshots/ios-uri-scheme-project.png)

Alternatively, you can add the URI scheme in your project's Info page.

1. In Xcode, click your project in the Navigator (on the left side).
1. Select the "Info" tab.
1. Expand the "URL Types" section at the bottom.
1. Click the "+" sign to add a new URI Scheme, as below:

![URL Scheme Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BranchMetrics/Branch-Unity-SDK/8670cf9347e4d7c9a88e7c9c4263aa2eed3f2a27/Docs/Screenshots/ios-uri-scheme-plist.png)

#### Android
In your project's manifest file, you can register your app to respond to direct deep links (yourapp:// in a mobile browser) by adding the second intent filter block. Also, make sure to change **yourapp** to a unique string that represents your app name.

Typically, you would register some sort of splash activitiy that handles routing for your app.

```xml
<activity
  android:name="com.yourapp.SplashActivity"
  android:label="@string/app_name" >
  <intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
  </intent-filter>

  <!-- Add this intent filter below, and change yourapp to your app name -->
  <intent-filter>
    <data android:scheme="yourapp" android:host="open" />
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
  </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

### Initialize SDK And Register Deep Link Routing Function

Called when app first initializes a session, ideally in a class that is initiated with the start of your scene. If you created a custom link with your own custom dictionary data, you probably want to know when the user session init finishes, so you can check that data. Think of this callback as your "deep link router". If your app opens with some data, you want to route the user depending on the data you passed in. Otherwise, send them to a generic install flow.

This deep link routing callback is called 100% of the time on init, with your link params or an empty dictionary if none present.

###### C Sharp
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class MyCoolBehaviorScript : MonoBehaviour {
    void Start () {
        Branch.initSession(delegate(Dictionary<string, object> parameters, string error) {
            if (error != null) {
                System.Console.WriteLine("Oh no, something went wrong: " + error);
            }
            else if (parameters.Count > 0) {
                System.Console.WriteLine("Branch initialization completed with the following params: " + parameters.Keys);
            }
        });
    }
}
```

#### Retrieve session (install or open) parameters

These session parameters will be available at any point later on with this command. If no params, the dictionary will be empty. This refreshes with every new session (app installs AND app opens)

###### C Sharp
```
Dictionary<string, object> sessionParams = Branch.getLatestReferringParams();
```


#### Retrieve install (install only) parameters

If you ever want to access the original session params (the parameters passed in for the first install event only), you can use this line. This is useful if you only want to reward users who newly installed the app from a referral link or something.

###### C Sharp
```
Dictionary<string, object> installParams = Branch.getFirstReferringParams();
```


### Persistent identities

Often, you might have your own user IDs, or want referral and event data to persist across platforms or uninstall/reinstall. It's helpful if you know your users access your service from different devices. This where we introduce the concept of an 'identity'.

To identify a user, just call:


###### C Sharp
```
Branch.setIdentity("your user id");
```

#### Logout

If you provide a logout function in your app, be sure to clear the user when the logout completes. This will ensure that all the stored parameters get cleared and all events are properly attributed to the right identity.

**Warning** this call will clear the referral credits and attribution on the device.

###### C Sharp
```
Branch.logout();
```

### Register custom events
###### C Sharp
```
Branch.userCompletedAction("your_custom_event"); // your custom event name should not exceed 63 characters
```

OR if you want to store some state with the event
###### C Sharp
```
Dictionary<string, object> stateItems = new Dictionary<string, object>
{
  { "username", "Joe" },
  { "description", "Joe likes long walks on the beach..." }
};
Branch.userCompletedAction("your_custom_event", stateItems); // same 63 characters max limit
```

Some example events you might want to track:
###### C Sharp
```
"complete_purchase"
"wrote_message"
"finished_level_ten"
```

## Generate Tracked, Deep Linking URLs (pass data across install and open)

### Shortened links

There are a bunch of options for creating these links. You can tag them for analytics in the dashboard, or you can even pass data to the new installs or opens that come from the link click. How awesome is that? You need to pass a callback for when you link is prepared (which should return very quickly, ~ 50 ms to process).

For more details on how to create links, see the [Branch link creation guide](https://github.com/BranchMetrics/Branch-Integration-Guides/blob/master/url-creation-guide.md)

###### C Sharp
```
// associate data with a link
// you can access this data from any instance that installs or opens the app from this link (amazing...)

Dictionary<string, object> parameters = new Dictionary<string, object>
{
  { "user", "Joe" },
  { "profile_pic", "https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/myapp/joes_pic.jpg" },
  { "description", "Joe likes long walks on the beach..." },

  // Customize the display of the link
  { "$og_title", "Joe's My App Referral" },
  { "$og_image_url", "https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/myapp/joes_pic.jpg" },
  { "$og_description", "Join Joe in My App - it's awesome" },

  // Customize the redirect performance
  { "$desktop_url", "http://myapp.com/desktop_splash" }
}

// associate a url with a set of tags, channel, feature, and stage for better analytics.
// tags: null or example set of tags could be "version1", "trial6", etc; each tag should not exceed 64 characters
// channel: null or examples: "facebook", "twitter", "text_message", etc; should not exceed 128 characters
// feature: null or examples: FEATURE_TAG_SHARE, FEATURE_TAG_REFERRAL, "unlock", etc; should not exceed 128 characters
// stage: null or examples: "past_customer", "logged_in", "level_6"; should not exceed 128 characters

// Link 'type' can be used for scenarios where you want the link to only deep link the first time.
// Use 0, 1 (BranchLinkTypeUnlimitedUse), or 2 (BranchLinkTypeOneTimeUse)

// Link 'alias' can be used to label the endpoint on the link. For example: http://bnc.lt/AUSTIN28. Should not exceed 128 characters
// Be careful about aliases: these are immutable objects permanently associated with the data and associated paramters you pass into the link. When you create one in the SDK, it's tied to that user identity as well (automatically specified by the Branch internals). If you want to retrieve the same link again, you'll need to call getShortUrl with all of the same parameters from before.

List<strings> tags = [ "version1", "trial6" ];
string channel = "text_message";
string feature = "SHARE";
string stage = "level_6";
string alias = "AUSTIN68";
Branch.getShortURLWithTags(parameters, tags, channel, feature, stage, alias, delegate(string url, string error) {
    // show the link to the user or share it immediately
});

// The callback will return null if the link generation fails (or if the alias specified is aleady taken.)
```


There are other methods which exclude tag and data if you don't want to pass those.

**Note**
You can customize the Facebook OG tags of each URL if you want to dynamically share content by using the following _optional keys in the data dictionary_:

| Key | Value
| --- | ---
| "$og_title" | The title you'd like to appear for the link in social media
| "$og_description" | The description you'd like to appear for the link in social media
| "$og_image_url" | The URL for the image you'd like to appear for the link in social media
| "$og_video" | The URL for the video
| "$og_url" | The URL you'd like to appear
| "$og_app_id" | Your OG app ID. Optional and rarely used.

Also, you do custom redirection by inserting the following _optional keys in the dictionary_:

| Key | Value
| --- | ---
| "$desktop_url" | Where to send the user on a desktop or laptop. By default it is the Branch-hosted text-me service
| "$android_url" | The replacement URL for the Play Store to send the user if they don't have the app. _Only necessary if you want a mobile web splash_
| "$ios_url" | The replacement URL for the App Store to send the user if they don't have the app. _Only necessary if you want a mobile web splash_
| "$ipad_url" | Same as above but for iPad Store
| "$fire_url" | Same as above but for Amazon Fire Store
| "$blackberry_url" | Same as above but for Blackberry Store
| "$windows_phone_url" | Same as above but for Windows Store

You have the ability to control the direct deep linking of each link by inserting the following _optional keys in the dictionary_:

| Key | Value
| --- | ---
| "$deeplink_path" | The value of the deep link path that you'd like us to append to your URI. For example, you could specify "$deeplink_path": "radio/station/456" and we'll open the app with the URI "yourapp://radio/station/456?link_click_id=branch-identifier". This is primarily for supporting legacy deep linking infrastructure.
| "$always_deeplink" | true or false. (default is not to deep link first) This key can be specified to have our linking service force try to open the app, even if we're not sure the user has the app installed. If the app is not installed, we fall back to the respective app store or $platform_url key. By default, we only open the app if we've seen a user initiate a session in your app from a Branch link (has been cookied and deep linked by Branch)

## Referral system rewarding functionality

In a standard referral system, you have 2 parties: the original user and the invitee. Our system is flexible enough to handle rewards for all users for any actions. Here are a couple example scenarios:

1) Reward the original user for taking action (eg. inviting, purchasing, etc)

2) Reward the invitee for installing the app from the original user's referral link

3) Reward the original user when the invitee takes action (eg. give the original user credit when their the invitee buys something)

These reward definitions are created on the dashboard, under the 'Reward Rules' section in the 'Referrals' tab on the dashboard.

Warning: For a referral program, you should not use unique awards for custom events and redeem pre-identify call. This can allow users to cheat the system.

### Get reward balance

Reward balances change randomly on the backend when certain actions are taken (defined by your rules), so you'll need to make an asynchronous call to retrieve the balance. Here is the syntax:

###### C Sharp
```
Branch.loadRewards(delegate(bool changed, string error) {
    // changed boolean will indicate if the balance changed from what is currently in memory

    // will return the balance of the current user's credits
    int credits = Branch.getCredits();
});
```


### Redeem all or some of the reward balance (store state)

We will store how many of the rewards have been deployed so that you don't have to track it on your end. In order to save that you gave the credits to the user, you can call redeem. Redemptions will reduce the balance of outstanding credits permanently.

###### C Sharp
```
// Save that the user has redeemed 5 credits
Branch.redeemRewards(5);
```

### Get credit history

This call will retrieve the entire history of credits and redemptions from the individual user. To use this call, implement like so:

###### C Sharp
```
Branch.getCreditHistory(delegate(List<string> historyItems, string error) {
    if (error == null) {
        // process history
    }
});
```

The response will return an array that has been parsed from the following JSON:
```json
[
    {
        "transaction": {
                           "date": "2014-10-14T01:54:40.425Z",
                           "id": "50388077461373184",
                           "bucket": "default",
                           "type": 0,
                           "amount": 5
                       },
        "referrer": "12345678",
        "referree": null
    },
    {
        "transaction": {
                           "date": "2014-10-14T01:55:09.474Z",
                           "id": "50388199301710081",
                           "bucket": "default",
                           "type": 2,
                           "amount": -3
                       },
        "referrer": null,
        "referree": "12345678"
    }
]
```
**referrer**
: The id of the referring user for this credit transaction. Returns null if no referrer is involved. Note this id is the user id in developer's own system that's previously passed to Branch's identify user API call.

**referree**
: The id of the user who was referred for this credit transaction. Returns null if no referree is involved. Note this id is the user id in developer's own system that's previously passed to Branch's identify user API call.

**type**
: This is the type of credit transaction

1. _0_ - A reward that was added automatically by the user completing an action or referral
1. _1_ - A reward that was added manually
2. _2_ - A redemption of credits that occurred through our API or SDKs
3. _3_ - This is a very unique case where we will subtract credits automatically when we detect fraud

### Get referral code

Retrieve the referral code created by current user

###### C Sharp
```
Branch.getReferralCode(delegate(Dictionary<string, object> referralObject, string error) {
    if (error == null) {
        string referralCode = referralObject["referral_code"];
    }
});
```

### Create referral code

Create a new referral code for the current user, only if this user doesn't have any existing non-expired referral code.

In the simplest form, just specify an amount for the referral code.
The returned referral code is a 6 character long unique alpha-numeric string wrapped inside the params dictionary with key @"referral_code".

**amount** _int_
: The amount of credit to redeem when user applies the referral code

###### C Sharp
```
int amount = 5;
Branch.getCreditHistory(amount, delegate(Dictionary<string, object> referralObject, string error) {
    if (error == null) {
        string referralCode = referralObject["referral_code"];
    }
});
```

Alternatively, you can specify a prefix for the referral code.
The resulting code will have your prefix, concatenated with a 4 character long unique alpha-numeric string wrapped in the same data structure.

**prefix** _string_
: The prefix to the referral code that you desire


###### C Sharp
```
int amount = 5;
string prefix = "BRANCH";
Branch.getCreditHistory(prefix, amount, delegate(Dictionary<string, object> referralObject, string error) {
    if (error == null) {
        string referralCode = referralObject["referral_code"];
    }
});
```

If you want to specify an expiration date for the referral code, you can add an "expiration:" parameter.
The prefix parameter is optional here, i.e. it could be getReferralCodeWithAmount:expiration:andCallback.

**expiration** _DateTime_
: The expiration date of the referral code

###### C Sharp
```
int amount = 5;
string prefix = "BRANCH";
DateTime expiration = DateTime.Now.AddDays(1);
Branch.getCreditHistory(prefix, amount, delegate(Dictionary<string, object> referralObject, string error) {
    if (error == null) {
        string referralCode = referralObject["referral_code"];
    }
});
```

You can also tune the referral code to the finest granularity, with the following additional parameters:

**bucket** _string_
: The name of the bucket to use. If none is specified, defaults to 'default'

**calculation_type**  _int_
: This defines whether the referral code can be applied indefinitely, or only once per user

0 (_BranchUnlimitedRewards_) - referral code can be applied continually
1 (_BranchUniqueRewards_) - a user can only apply a specific referral code once

**location** _int_
: The user to reward for applying the referral code

0 (_BranchReferreeUser_) - the user applying the referral code receives credit
1 (_BranchReferringUser_) - the user who created the referral code receives credit
2 (_BranchBothUsers_) - both the creator and applicant receive credit

###### C Sharp
```
int amount = 5;
string prefix = "BRANCH";
DateTime expiration = DateTime.Now.AddDays(1);
string bucket = "default";
int calcType = 1;
int location = 2;
Branch.getCreditHistory(prefix, amount, bucket, calcType, location, delegate(Dictionary<string, object> referralObject, string error) {
    if (error == null) {
        string referralCode = referralObject["referral_code"];
    }
});
```


### Validate referral code

Validate if a referral code exists in Branch system and is still valid.
A code is vaild if:

1. It hasn't expired.
1. If its calculation type is uniqe, it hasn't been applied by current user.

If valid, returns the referral code JSONObject in the call back.

**code** _string_
: The referral code to validate

###### C Sharp
```
Branch.validateReferralCode(code, delegate(Dictionary<string, object> referralObject, string error) {
  if (error != null) {
    System.Console.WriteLine("Error in validating referral code: " + error);
    return;
  }

  string referralCode = referralObject["referral_code"];
  if (referralCode == code) {
    // valid
  }
  else {
    // invalid (should never happen)
  }
});
```

### Apply referral code

Apply a referral code if it exists in Branch system and is still valid (see above). If the code is valid, returns the referral code JSONObject in the call back.

**code** _string_
: The referral code to apply

###### C Sharp
```
Branch.applyReferralCode(code, delegate(Dictionary<string, object> referralObject, string error) {
    if (error == null) {
        // applied. you can get the referral code amount from the params and deduct it in your UI.
    }
    else {
        System.Console.WriteLine("Error in applying referral code: " + error);
    }
});
```
